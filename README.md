#landing-page

This project is about showing some Sights of Germany and is 
one of the most interesting projects that I have done 
because, apart from using the concepts I already knew, 
I also used one of the revolutionary concepts of 
web development, namely Flexbox, and I got help from it 
in arranging the components of the page.
